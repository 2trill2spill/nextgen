/**
 * Main is the entry point to nextgen. In main we check for root, unfortunetly we need root to execute.
 * This is because we have to use dtrace, as well as bypass sandboxes, inject code into processes and 
 * other activities that require root access. We then create shared memory so we can share information
 * between processes. Next we parse the command line for user arguments and we stick the results in the
 * shared memory map. After parsing we set up the enviroment to the user's specfications and then finnaly
 * start the runtime, ie start fuzzing.
