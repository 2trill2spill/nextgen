# nextgen
A Genetic File, Sycall and Network Fuzzer for Unix systems.

Real README.md coming soon, I just need to finish the project first!

In the mean time `FreeBSD` and `Mac OSX` user's can download and install capstone from http://www.capstone-engine.org/download.html and then build nextgen with `gmake`.

Nextgen will be ported to other operating systems besides `FreeBSD` and will be implemented in this order `Mac OSX`, `illumos`, `Linux`, `OpenBSD`, and finally `NetBSD`. The community can take care of the rest.

#Syscall fuzzing

sudo ./nextgen --syscall --out /dirpath/to/save/results
