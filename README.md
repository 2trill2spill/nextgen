# nextgen
A Genetic File, Sycall and Network Fuzzer for Unix systems.

Real README.md coming soon, I just need to finish the project first!

In the mean time `FreeBSD` user's can build nextgen with `gmake` and test nextgen with `gmake test`.

Nextgen will be ported to other operating systems besides `FreeBSD` and will be implemented in this order `Mac OSX`, `illumos`, `Linux`, `OpenBSD`, and finally `NetBSD`. The community can take care of the rest.
